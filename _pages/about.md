I am Ganxiang Yang (杨淦翔), a senior undergraduate at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home),
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). 
It's been a pleasure living and studying with my talented and diligent classmates, from whom I've learned a lot.

Currently, I am fortunate to work with Asst. Prof. [Guoxing Chen](https://donnod.github.io/) at [NSEC Lab](https://nsec.sjtu.edu.cn/)
and participate in a research internship with Assoc. Prof. [Xinyu Xing](http://xinyuxing.org/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/).
My research interests lie in <span style="font-weight: bold">building secure and reliable systems via formal methods</span>. I am also quite interested in <span style="font-weight: bold">systems security and privacy</span>. Details about my research interests are shown by my previous publications and projects below.
