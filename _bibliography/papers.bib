  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={{\textsc\{Palantír\}}: Formally Verified Privileged Enclave as a Lightweight and Efficient Framework Extension},
  author={Yang, Ganxiang and Liu, Chenyang and Huang, Zhen and Chen, Guoxing and Fu, Hongfei and Zhang, Yuanyuan and Zhu, Haojin},
  abstract={Trusted execution environments (TEE) adopt the strong spatial isolation design to protect security-critical applications in the enclave, However, this isolation imposes significant limitations on the functionality and usability of the enclaves. This paper presents {\textsc\{Palantír\}}, a formally verified framework providing a comprehensive methodology for introducing new services to the enclave. By proposing a Privileged Enclave (PE) framework, {\textsc\{Palantír\}} relaxes the spatial isolation assumption. In particular, we grant specific enclaves privileges over others and introduce a unilateral trust model, allowing for improved enclave usability while ensuring security. To tackle security concerns, we verified our extended framework does not break or weaken the security guarantees of enclaves by building a formal model named 
  {TAP^2}, which is significantly extended from the Trusted Abstract Platform (TAP), an existing formal model. To show feasibility, we implemented our design on Penglai, an existing RISC-V enclave platform. Based on this, we achieved three case studies with distinct usage scenarios and goals to showcase the effective enhancement of enclave usability achieved by {\textsc\{Palantír\}}.},

  title={{\textsc\{ShadowBound\}}:Efficient Heap Memory Protection Through Advanced Metadata Management and Customized Compiler Optimization},
  author={Yu, Zheng and Yang, Ganxiang and Xing, Xinyu},
  abstract={In software development, the prevalence of unsafe languages such as C and C++ introduces potential vulnerabilities, 
  especially within the heap, a pivotal component for dynamic memory allocation. 
  Despite its significance, heap management complexities have made heap corruption pervasive, 
  posing severe threats to system security. While prior solutions aiming for temporal and spatial memory safety exhibit overheads deemed impractical,
   we present \textsc\{ShadowBound\}, a unique heap memory protection design. At its core, \textsc\{ShadowBound\} is an efficient out-of-bounds defense that integrates with various use-after-free defenses without compatibility constraints. We harness a shadow memory-based metadata management mechanism to store heap chunk boundaries and apply customized compiler optimizations tailored for boundary checking. Built atop LLVM 15, \textsc\{ShadowBound\} incorporates three state-of-the-art use-after-free defenses. Our evaluations show that \textsc\{ShadowBound\} provides robust protection against heap out-of-bound bugs with minimal time and memory overhead, suggesting its applicability and effectiveness in safeguarding real-world programs against prevalent heap vulnerabilities.},
